# Frontend API Configuration
# The frontend automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate API base URL:
# - Development (localhost): http://localhost:8000
# - Production (Netlify): https://yupooscraper.onrender.com

# For local development, ensure the backend is running on http://localhost:8000
# For production on Netlify, the backend must be deployed to Render at https://yupooscraper.onrender.com
